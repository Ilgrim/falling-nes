# falling-nes

Falling is an NES game written in 6502 assembly.

This is my first go at both assembly programming and designing an entire game from scratch. The project took 11 days and 130+ hours.

### Usage
To play, `falling.nes` can be loaded into an NES emulator such as FCEUX or Bizhawk.
To assemble from source, run `NESASM3 falling.asm` using the NESASM v3.1 assembler (link below).
